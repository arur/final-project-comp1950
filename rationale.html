    <h1>Rationale - Team AKA</h1>
    <p>Through a thorough analysis of the clients and end-users needs, we were able to identify the top three goals for the COMP1950 website:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ability to use lecture notes as an effective study aid</li>
      <li>Ability to easily access in-class exercises</li>
      <li>Ability to create an online learning environment that is supportive and intuitive</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>Current Issues</h2>
      <p>With the above goals kept in mind, we analyzed the current COMP1950 website and identified the following issues.</p>
      <h3>Difficult to Find Information</h3>
      <p>The current website has one long page for each of it's eleven lectures. While the student is able to go to the lecture of their choice via the right sidebar, the content structure of each lecture layout page proves to be difficult to find information, access exercises, and view examples. The student is constantly scrolling up and down each lecture page or using the ctrl+f option in order to search for specific information. This proves to be a less effective learning experience, as the student spends more time searching for information rather than digesting information.</p>

      <h3>Very Text Heavy</h3>
      <p>The current website is very text heavy, which in addition with the long page scroll, creates an overwhelming experience for the student. The headings used is the same or similar size to the body copy, and in general, there is a lack of headings used throughout the entire website. This decreases usability and visual consistency as it does not allow students to easily scan the content.</p>

      <h3>Not Visually Appealing</h3>
      <p>The current website uses three main colours in it's colour scheme: maroon, light and dark grey, and black. The current colour scheme is dull and uninspiring. This differs from the client's request of wanting the website to be visually appealing and enthusiastic yet professional. </p>

    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
      <h3>Multi-Tier Navigation</h3>
      <p>We propose a 'multi-tier' navigation which includes a horizontal main menu and a left sidebar menu. The main menu portrays the websites parent pages while while the sidebar menu portrays the child pages or child content of the respective parent page. With the sidebar, students can easily locate information within that page by clicking on the submenu item, which will bring the student to the respective content. The addition of the sidebar also prevents from having one deep nested navigation.</p>

      <h3>Sectioned Lecture Submenus</h3>
      <p>Each lecture will be divided into different sections, with each section appearing as a submenu item on the sidebar. Students will be able to expand each lecture, and navigate to their preferred section of the lecture by clicking on the respective submenu item. Other than viewing the course contents, the student will be able to easily navigate to the exercises, homework assignments, and learning objectives. </p>

      <h3>Seperate Exercise Section</h3>
      <p>Students can now easily find the lecture exercises through the 'exercise section' which will appear within each lecture's submenu. Not only does this allow the student easier access to the exercises, but also allows the student to view the number and type of exercises at a glance. The exercises will appear on the same page as it's respective lecture counterpart rather than a seperate parent page. This is important as it allows the student to follow the flow of the lecture and to be able to easily associate the exercise with relevant parts of the lecture.</p>

      <h3>Searchable Content</h3>
      <p>With the addition of a search bar in the header, the student can now easily find information using keywords without having to dig into each lecture page.</p>

      <h3>Student Forum</h3>
      <p>Being able to engage and interact with your classmates and professor is just as important outside of the classroom. Our proposed student form now only allows the student to ask questions but also creates a supportive online learning environment. The addition of a forum allows students and their professor to discuss topics such as homework assignements, lecture notes, or current website trends.</p>

      <h3>Captivating Homepage</h3>
      <p>As the main landing page, the homepage should create a first good impression and be able to tell the viewer what the website is used for. Our proposed homepage is complete with a compelling image and effective call to action. Upon landing on the homepage, the viewer will be able to easily understand the website goals. </p>

      <h3>Friendly &amp; Professional Colour Scheme</h3>
      <p>As the primary learning tool for the course, it is integral that the website can create an environment that is friendly, professional, and engaging. Our proposed colour scheme...</p>

      <h3>Back-To-Top Feature</h3>
      <p>Simple yet effective, our addition of a more visible and intuitive back-to-top feature decreases the amount of scrolling the student has to do. While the current website has this feature, it is not easily visible as it only appears at the bottom of each page.</p>

      <h3>Other</h3>

        <li>breadcrumbs</li>
