			<h1 class="section-heading">Rationale</h1>
		   <p class="p-margin-bottom">Through a thorough analysis of the clients and end-users needs, we were able to identify the top three goals for the COMP1950 website:</p>
		   <ol>
		      <li>Ability to use lecture notes as an effective study aid</li>
		      <li>Ability to easily access in-class exercises</li>
		      <li>Ability to create an online learning environment that is supportive and intuitive</li>
		   </ol>
			
			
		   <h2>Current Issues</h2>

		      <p class="p-margin-bottom">With the above goals kept in mind, we analyzed the current COMP1950 website and identified the following issues.</p>
		      
		      <div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Difficult to Find Information</h3>
		      <p>The current content structure of each lecture page makes it difficult to find information, access exercises, and view examples. The student is constantly scrolling up and down each page to search for specific information. This proves to be a less effective learning experience, as the student spends more time searching for information rather than digesting information.</p>
		      </div>

		      <div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Very Text Heavy</h3>
		      <p>The current website is very text heavy, which in addition with the long page scroll, creates an overwhelming experience for the student. The headings used is the same or similar size to the body copy, and in general, there is a lack of headings used throughout the entire website. This decreases usability and visual consistency as it does not allow students to easily scan the content.</p>
		      </div>

		      <div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Not Visually Appealing</h3>
		      <p>The current website uses three main colours in it's colour scheme: maroon, light and dark grey, and black. The current colour scheme is dull and uninspiring. This differs from the client's request of wanting the website to be visually appealing and enthusiastic yet professional. </p>
		      </div>
		
		   <h2 class="clear-float">Our Solution</h2>
		   

		    	<div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Multi-Tier Navigation</h3>
		      <p>A multi-tier navigation will allow students to easily find information and relevant content within lecture notes and other parent pages. Complete with a horizontal main menu and a left sidebar menu, this new navigation also prevents from having a single deep nested navigation.</p>
		      </div>

		      <div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Sectioned Lecture Submenus</h3>
		      <p>Each lecture will be divided into different sections, with each section appearing as a submenu item on the sidebar. Students will be able to expand each lecture, and navigate to their preferred section of the lecture by clicking on the respective submenu item, such as exercises, homework assignments, and learning objectives. </p>
		      </div>

		      <div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Seperate Exercise Section</h3>
		      <p>Students can now easily access the lecture exercises via the 'exercise section' which will appear within each lecture's sidebar. Keeping the exercises on its respective lecture page allows the student to follow the flow of the lecture and to be able to easily associate the exercise with relevant parts of the lecture.</p>
		      </div>

		      <div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Searchable Content</h3>
		      <p>With the addition of a search bar in the header, students can now easily find information using keywords without having to spend more time digging through each lecture page.</p>
		      </div>

		      <div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Student Forum</h3>
		      <p>Being able to engage and interact with your classmates and professor is just as important outside of the classroom. Our student forum now only allows the student to ask questions but also creates a supportive online learning environment. Students and their professor can discuss topics such as homework assignments, lecture notes, or current website trends.</p>
		      </div>

		      <div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Captivating Homepage</h3>
		      <p>As the main landing page, the homepage should create a first good impression and be able to tell the viewer what the website is used for. Our homepage is complete with a compelling image and effective call to action. Upon landing on the homepage, the viewer will be able to easily understand the website goals. </p>
		      </div>

		      <div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Inviting Colour Scheme</h3>
		      <p>As the primary learning tool for the course, it is integral that the website can create an environment that invites the viewer to want to stay on the website. Our proposed colour scheme of blue, golden-yellow, and light grey creates a healthy balance between professional, educational, and engaging.</p>
		      </div>

		      <div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Back-To-Top Feature</h3>
		      <p>Simple yet effective, our addition of a more visible and intuitive back-to-top feature decreases the amount of scrolling the student has to do. While the current website has this feature, it is not easily visible as it only appears at the bottom of each page.</p>
		      </div>

		      <div class="three-columns">
		      <h3>Jquery blah</h3>
		      <p>
